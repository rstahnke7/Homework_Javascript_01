# Homework_Javascript_01
This repository holds the .html file that holds the code for the Bill Watrous website that I created for this assignment. Because it was a simple website, I did not create separate files for each of the navbar pages. Bootstrap was used to make sure the website would be responsive to screen size, plus several Bootstrap components were added to enhance the website's design.

The .js file contains code for four functions:
* Function 1 validates a person's email making sure the special characters used in an email are present in whatever email the person entered.
* Function 2 picks out a random Bill Watrous song to play
* Function 3 keeps a running total of the various albums that a user might want to buy from the website.
* Function 4 scans key words from each comment to determine if the comment was psitive, negative or neutral.
